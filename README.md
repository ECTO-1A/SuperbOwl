Turns ESP8266 into a WIFI controlled IR device with an option to set future trigger times through the web interface.


KNOWN ISSUES:

- "Trigger is not set" message isnt updating (should show all info from set trigger)

FUTURE PLANS:

-Wifi trigger (activate IR signal when specific wifi network is seen)
-ability to trigger each other in a mini "botnet" where when connected to, it begins broadcasting the name of the "trigger" wifi network to others that then kick off the same process.
-Dropdowns for Makes and Models of IR devices
- better solution for handeling raw hex of IR signal
- ability to set multiple triggers for different devices
- option to select either trigger by DATE or WIFI
